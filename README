KDIC Streaming App

The KDIC Streaming App is a convenient way for anyone to tune into their
favorite radio station, KDIC, based out of Grinnell College, IA. The app
allows you to pause and play the station, and pulls metadata from the
stream to display. On top of streaming KDIC, the app also brings the user
content from the KDIC website (http://kdic.grinnell.edu), such as the
program schedule, program description, community events, reviews, and so
much more.

KDIC Streaming App is currently in ALPHA.  This means the application is
in development and not yet fully functional.  

Source for KDIC Streaming App can be obtained at the following location:
	https://github.com/GrinnellAppDev/KDIC-Radio-Android

You can obtain the source with the following command:
	git clone git://github.com/GrinnellAppDev/KDIC-Radio-Android.git
